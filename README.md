# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge.

# Project Overview
The Escape Vanilla JS Challenge is an interactive web-based project focusing on debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction. You will navigate through three themed "rooms," each presenting a unique challenge that requires them to debug and correct given JavaScript code to proceed. This adventure is themed around escaping the confines of Vanilla JavaScript to advance towards learning React.

# Project Brief
- Correct the ID used in the event listener for Room 1.
- Use the correct element ID when displaying results for Room 1.
- Add the missing 'async' keyword to the JS concepts set.
- Correct the function call to find the intersection of `jsConcepts` and `reactConcepts` for Room 2.
- Ensure asynchronous operations are handled correctly in Room 3, particularly by adding `await` before the promise in `navigateLabyrinth`.
- Adjust the `findMostRecentBook` function to correctly compare dates and find the most recent book.
- Fix the `findIntersection` function to correctly determine the intersection of two sets.
- Add the `await` keyword before `new Promise` in `navigateLabyrinth` to ensure the simulation of asynchronous operations works as intended.


# Elements included 
1. Ensure that your code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
2. Your GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.
- Asynchronous programming 
- await Keywords 
- APIs 
- Promises

# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
Througout this project, I was able to master the following areas:
- Asynchronous programming. 
- Syntax structure of various JavaScript variable, functions, and methods.

Although I have declared the mastered areas, I feel as though I have not mastered them fully because I kept getting hit with the realisation that there is more I must learn about; I was able to discern that the more I learnt the more I realised that there is way more that I still need to learn.

### Challenges faced 
There were several challenges that I faced in this project, and most of them were great learning opportunities:

- I faced the challenge of learning to understand code that I had to debug instead of building from scratch and knowing why each line of code was used and why at that point. Reading and understanding code was an eye-opener in the sense that I had to know the code logic as well as the syntax.

-  Using the correct function names and variables also posed a bit of challenge in the beginning, before realising the code logic and what the author was intending to code.

### Areas of Improvement 
There are several areas I feel the need to improve on, chief among them being the further practice of reading and understanding code. I feel like I need to learn to read code more like a story so that I could figure out what the author wants to be the outcome and what's going to help them get there. I believe this will increase my skills greatly in terms of debugging any code I come across because I will now be atuned to the logic of the code and how its intended to work.

## Overall learning experience
My overall experience was probably the most positive it has ever been throughout my coding journey. I learnt a great deal throughout this project and most of the experience was due to having to go back on my notes an reflect on past lessons so that I may implement them. I surprised myself a lot during this project due to my growing love for coding and being able to understand code better, I even found myself enjoying Javascrpit and making notes so that I may use them in future projects. I learnt a lot about the importance of debugging and how to use the quokka extension as a great tool for debugging. I would give my overall learning experience a 7.5/10.
